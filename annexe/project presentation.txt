My project is a project to create an interactive fiction website with a character that is created at the time of registration. This project is inspired by the books where you are the hero, particularly by "Lone Wolf," but also by fantastic manga from which it takes elements of shonen where the character evolves through adventures, and finally by the adventures of the "Player from the Attic" from which it takes simplicity. The site will have a homepage where news will be read, an account creation page where one side provides certain personal information and the other where the character will be created, a character sheet page retrievable from the back end, fiction pages, and story pages where choices will be made.
