Hello, my name is José miey, and living in Roquecourbe. 

I am currently undergoing training at the digital center of ADRAR, and I am a self-employed  with  diplomas in accounting and in commerce.


One of my earliest creations is 858.fr, a website where users become the hero of their own story.

 It’s an interactive, narrative-driven experience inspired by classic adventure books, designed to engage users in playful decision-making and storytelling.

More recently, I developed Roquebiz, a promotional site created this month to support the local market of Roquecourbe. 

He highlights the various participants—artisans, producers, and sellers—giving them an online presence and advertising for them.

During the summer holidays in August, I created LinWitch, a fake Linux distribution that’s more of an artistic and technical experiment. It boots directly into a browser.

"Finally, the main project I’d like to present is Heroclick Adventure. It’s based on the concept of 858.fr, but taken much further. One of the key improvements is the addition of a personal profile that evolves over time, depending on the user’s actions after registration."
